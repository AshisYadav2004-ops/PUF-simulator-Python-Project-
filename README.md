# PUF-simulator-Python-Project-
 This project simulates a Physical Unclonable Function (PUF) in Python and trains a neural network (using TensorFlow) to predict PUF responses. The simulator models the challenge-response behavior of a PUF, while the neural network attempts to learn the mapping â€” demonstrating how machine learning can analyze hardware-level security primitives.
